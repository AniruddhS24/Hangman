# Hangman
(old project, uploaded to GitHub recently)

A fun Java app for Hangman! This is an old project from years ago which I have stored on here recently (slowly learning to become an active GitHub user), so there may be some issues with some files.
Looking back, my drawing of the man is atrocious (for my "UI"), but nonetheless it's a fun game!
